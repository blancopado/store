## AngularJS Store

###### I have developed a front-end Store using HTML, JavaScript, AngularJS, CSS3 & Bootstrap.

This is how the front-end app looks like:

I have completed the first three user stories:

1. As a User I can add a product to my shopping cart.
2. As a User I can remove a product from my shopping cart.
3. As a User I can view the total price for the products in my shopping
cart.

I didn't have time to complete any other story :(


##Instructions:

Make sure you have node and bower installed:

node -v
bower -v

Make sure they both return a version number. Otherwise you will need to install them:

brew install node
npm install -g bower


There isn't any back-end scaffolding, so after cloning the repo in your computer, 'cd' in the app directory and run 'bower install' and 'npm install'. Then start a server: "http-server".

Thank you!
